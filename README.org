* Build common machine learning classifiers from scratch

All classifiers are built from scratch in pure python. The code style is
inspired from Scikit-Learn. Being able to build these classifiers enable me to
gain a better understanding of how machine learning algorithms work behind the
scene.

Each model is tested with a dataset, and demonstrated in jupyter notebooks for
better visualization.
